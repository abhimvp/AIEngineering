# AI Engineering Bootcamp: RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) for LLMs

Your notes are not a performance; they are your personal scaffolding for understanding. The clarity you build within them is your superpower, not a public spectacle. Write for your future self, not for anyone else's judgment.

## Section 1: Introduction to Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) Systems

- the course materials store them in my Google Drive(AI Engineering) since I will use Google Colab & after done with the file , i will upload them in this repo.
- Refer offline notes as well.

## SectionTwo: Fundamentals of Retrieval Systems

- Read Offline Notes first.

- `stepOne.ipynb` : Tokenization and pre-processing & `practicalTips`
- `use this command to install libraries in our jupyter notebooks` - `!uv add requests`
- OpenAI Tokenizer & [Gemini Token counting](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/tokens?lang=python)
